<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) markdown blog refers to a markdown-based blogging system that allows users to perform essential operations on their blog content. Here's how this markdown blog can be used:

Create New Blog Posts: Users can easily create new blog posts using markdown syntax. By writing the content in plain text, bloggers can focus on the writing process without distractions. They can use their preferred markdown editor or a dedicated blogging platform that supports markdown.

Read and View Blog Posts: The CRUD markdown blog provides a user interface to read and view existing blog posts. Users can access their published posts and navigate through them using a user-friendly interface. The markdown content is parsed and displayed as formatted HTML for easy reading.

Update and Edit Blog Posts: One of the primary features of a CRUD markdown blog is the ability to update and edit existing blog posts. Users can make changes to the markdown content, such as adding or modifying text, inserting images or links, formatting text, or making other revisions to the post's content.

Delete Blog Posts: If users decide to remove a blog post, the CRUD markdown blog allows them to delete the post from the system. This operation removes the post's entry and associated files, ensuring that it is no longer accessible on the blog.

Publish and Unpublish Posts: Users can publish their blog posts to make them visible to readers. The CRUD markdown blog provides an interface to control the publication status of each post. Additionally, users can choose to unpublish a post temporarily or set it as a draft for future publication.
